			 * The trig involved in calculating the new width and height
			 * is fairly simple; the hard part was remembering that when 
			 * PI/2 <= theta <= PI and 3PI/2 <= theta < 2PI the width and 
			 * height are switched.
			 * 
			 * When you rotate a rectangle, r, the bounding box surrounding r
			 * contains for right-triangles of empty space.  Each of the 
			 * triangles hypotenuse's are a known length, either the width or
			 * the height of r.  Because we know the length of the hypotenuse
			 * and we have a known angle of rotation, we can use the trig
			 * function identities to find the length of the other two sides.
			 * 
			 * sine = opposite/hypotenuse
			 * cosine = adjacent/hypotenuse
			 * 
			 * solving for the unknown we get
			 * 
			 * opposite = sine * hypotenuse
			 * adjacent = cosine * hypotenuse
			 * 
			 * Another interesting point about these triangles is that there
			 * are only two different triangles. The proof for which is easy
			 * to see, but its been too long since I've written a proof that
			 * I can't explain it well enough to want to publish it.  
			 * 
			 * Just trust me when I say the triangles formed by the lengths 
			 * width are always the same (for a given theta) and the same 
			 * goes for the height of r.
			 * 
			 * Rather than associate the opposite/adjacent sides with the
			 * width and height of the original bitmap, I'll associate them
			 * based on their position.
			 * 
			 * adjacent/oppositeTop will refer to the triangles making up the 
			 * upper right and lower left corners
			 * 
			 * adjacent/oppositeBottom will refer to the triangles making up 
			 * the upper left and lower right corners
			 * 
			 * The names are based on the right side corners, because thats 
			 * where I did my work on paper (the right side).
			 * 
			 * Now if you draw this out, you will see that the width of the 
			 * bounding box is calculated by adding together adjacentTop and 
			 * oppositeBottom while the height is calculate by adding 
			 * together adjacentBottom and oppositeTop.
